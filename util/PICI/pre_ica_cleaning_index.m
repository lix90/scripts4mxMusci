% function [PICI outputStructure] = = pre_ica_cleaning_index(nonCleanedEEG, icaWeight, icaSphere)
%
% Calculates an index (Pre ICA Cleaning Index, or PICI) that can be used to compare the quality of ICA cleaning (e.g. artifact rejection)
% using median windowed mutual infromation method. In this method, Mutual information reduction
% index, or MIR is calculated in short ~1 s windows of the original (full, non rejected or otherwise cleaned data) and
% the median of these MIR values is calculated for both an ICA decomposition (often calculated on a
% separate, clean data) and an sphering matrix calculated based on a geometric-median calculated
% covariance matrix.
%
% To use this function you should run the same ICA algorthms (e.g Infomax) on the 'clean' portion of
% the data, and then use provide this ICA matrix along with FULL NON-REJECTED DATA in EEG input
% variable to this function. Please DO NOT send cleaned data in nonCleanedEEG variable to this function as
% this would certainly produce misleading results. The cleaning method that produces the highest
% PICI value is more suitable to be used in later analysis. Bad channels should be removed from
% nonCleanedEEG and all other EEG datasets before using this function.
%
% Also, this function may NOT be used to compare ICA solution from different number of channels (e.g. different bad channels removed) or
% ICA components. You need to always compare the same channel subset (unfortunetaly using PCA to
% reduce dimension will prevent you from this function either because Mutual Information reduction index cannot be used in this case).
%
% Again, if you use this function on cleaned (e.g. artifact rejected) data, the resulting PICI would completely
% meaningless and the 'quality jedgement' produced by the function would be certainly wrong.
%
% Usage Example:
%
% Let originalEEG be a contineous EEG dataset, and we want to compare the cleaning performance of
% methods 1 and 2:
%
% >> cleanEEG1 = clean_by_method_1(originalEEG);
% >> cleanEEG2 = clean_by_method_2(originalEEG);
%
% then we do ICA for data cleaned by these two methods
% >> cleanEEG1WithICA = do_ica(cleanEEG1);
% >> cleanEEG2WithICA = do_ica(cleanEEG2);
%
% then
% >> method1PIC = pre_ica_cleaning_index(nonCleanedEEG, cleanEEG1WithICA.icaweights, cleanEEG1WithICA.icasphere);
% >> method2PICI= pre_ica_cleaning_index(nonCleanedEEG, cleanEEG2WithICA.icaweights, cleanEEG2WithICA.icasphere);
%
% and then look at  method1ICQ - method2ICQ. Even a small difference in PICI (e.g. 1%) could makes a
% significant difference in resulting ICA quality.
