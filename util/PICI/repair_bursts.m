%
% This is an automated artifact rejection function that ensures that the data contains no events
% that have abnormally strong power; the subspaces on which those events occur are reconstructed 
% (interpolated) based on the rest of the EEG signal during these time periods.
%
% The basic principle is to first find a section of data that represents clean "reference" EEG and
% to compute statistics on there. Then, the function goes over the whole data in a sliding window
% and finds the subspaces in which there is activity that is more than a few standard deviations
% away from the reference EEG (this is a tunable parameter). Once the function has found the bad
% subspaces it will treat them as missing data and reconstruct their content using a mixing matrix
% that was calculated on the clean data.
%
% In:
%   Signal          : continuous data set, assumed to be appropriately high-passed (e.g. >0.5Hz or
%                     with a 0.5Hz - 1.0Hz transition band)
%
%   StandardDevCutoff: StdDev cutoff for rejection. Data segments whose variance is beyond this cutoff 
%                      from the distribution of variance across the recording are considered missing data.
%                      The reasonable range is 3 (fairly aggressive), 4 (fairly safe), or 5 (very safe,
%                      likely not harming any EEG). Default: 3.
%
%   The following are "specialty' parameters that usually do not have to be tuned. If you can't get
%   the function to do what you want, you might consider adapting these better to your data.
%
%   WindowLength    : Length of the statistcs window, in seconds. This should not be much longer 
%                     than the time scale over which artifacts persist, but the number of samples 
%                     in the window should not be smaller than 1.5x the number of channels. Default:
%                     max(0.5,1.5*Signal.nbchan/Signal.srate);
%
%   BlockSize       : Block granularity for processing. The reprojection matrix will be updated every 
%                     this many samples and a blended matrix is used for the in-between samples. If 
%                     empty this will be set the WindowLength/2 in samples. Default: []
%
%   MaxDimensions   : Maximum dimensionality to reconstruct. Up to this many dimensions (or up to 
%                     this fraction of dimensions) can be reconstructed for a given data segment. This is 
%                     since the lower eigenvalues are usually not estimated very well. Default: 2/3.
%
%   ReferenceMaxBadChannels: The maximum fraction of bad channels per time window of the data that 
%                            is used as clean reference EEG on which statistics are based. Instead
%                            of a number one may also directly pass in a data set that contains
%                            clean reference data (for example a minute of resting EEG). A lower
%                            values makes this criterion more aggressive. Reasonable range: 0.05
%                            (very aggressive) to 0.3 (quite lax). Default: 0.075.
%
%   ReferenceTolerances : These are the power tolerances beyond which a channel in the clean 
%                         reference data is considered "bad", in standard deviations relative
%                         to a robust EEG power distribution (lower and upper bound). 
%                         Default: [-5 3.5].
%
%   ReferenceWindowLength : Length of the windows that are considered reference-quality EEG. 
%                           Default: 1.
%
%   SpectralFilterSettings : Parameters for the spectrum-shaping filter that reweights frequencies
%                            according to their relevance for artifact detection. This is a cell
%                            array of {Frequencies,Amplitudes,Order} for a Yule-Walker IIR filter
%                            design. Note: These settings are very sensitive, do not change unless
%                            you know exactly what you're doing. Can also be the string 'basic'
%                            (for the basic 6th order setting) or 'sensitive' (for a high-frequency
%                            sensitive 8th order setting). Default: 'sensitive'.
