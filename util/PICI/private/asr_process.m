%
% In:
%   --- data-specific parameters ---
%
%   Data : Chunk of data to process [#channels x #samples]. This is a chunk of data, assumed to be
%          a continuation of the data that was passed in during the last call to asr_process.
%          The data should be high-pass filtered (the same way as for asr_calibrate) and of type double.
%          Also, if bad channels were removed before calling asr_calibrate, the same channels should 
%          be removed from data.
%   
%   SamplingRate : sampling rate of the data in Hz (e.g., 250.0)
%
%
%   --- processing parameters ---
%
%   WindowLength : Length of the statistcs window, in seconds (e.g., 0.5). This should not be much
%                  longer than the time scale over which artifacts persist, but the number of samples 
%                  in the window should not be smaller than 1.5x the number of channels.
%
%   LookAhead : Amount of look-ahead that the algorithm should use. Since the processing is causal,
%               the output signal will be delayed by this amount. This value is in seconds and should
%               be between 0 (no lookahead) and WindowLength/2 (optimal lookahead). The recommended
%               value is WindowLength/2.  This should be the same as what was used in the call to 
%               asr_calibrate.
%
%   StandardDevCutoff: Standard deviation cutoff for rejection. Data portions whose variance is larger
%                      than this threshold relative to the calibration data is considered missing data
%                      and will be removed. The recommended value is 3; the most aggressive value 
%                      that can be used without losing too much EEG is 2.5. A very conservative value 
%                      would be 4.
%
%   BlockSize       : The statistics will be updated every this many samples. The larger this is, 
%                     the faster the algorithm will be. The value must not be larger than 
%                     WindowLength*SamplingRate. The minimum value is 1 (update for every sample)
%                     while the recommended value is 32. 
%
%   MaxDimensions   : Maximum dimensionality of artifacts to remove. Up to this many dimensions (or 
%                     up to this fraction of dimensions) can be removed for a given data segment.
%                     The recommended value is 0.5. If the algorithm needs to tolerate extreme 
%                     artifacts you might increase this to 0.75 (the maximum fraction is 1.0).
%
%   MaxMemory : The maximum amount of memory used by the algorithm when processing a long chunk with
%               many channels, in MB. The recommended value is 256.
%
%   FilterB, FilterA : Coefficients of an IIR filter that is used to shape the spectrum of the signal
%                      when calculating artifact statistics. Must be the same as in asr_calibrate.
%
%   --- calibration parameters (this comes from asr_calibrate) ---
%
%   CovarianceMatrix : the covariance matrix C of the data
%
%   MixingMatrix : the mixing matrix M of the data
%
%   --- filter state (this is passed back in from the last call to asr_process or asr_calibrate) ---
%
%   StateOrd0 : zeroth-order initial filter state
%
%   StateOrd1 : first-order filter state
%
%   StateOrd2 : second-order filter state
%
%   StateBuffer : buffer state
%
%
% Out:
%   StateOrd0 : zeroth-order initial filter state
%
%   StateOrd1 : first-order updated filter state
%
%   StateOrd2 : second-order updated filter state
%
%   StateBuffer : updated buffer state
